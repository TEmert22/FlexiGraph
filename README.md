# Python-Stock-Program
A visual Python program utilising Yahoo Finance's API, machine learning, tkinter, and MatPlotLib to search for and display a graph of given stock price over a year.
The final outcome of this project should be:
- A beautiful looking GUI able to search for US stocks across multiple periods
- Machine learning component capable of summizing stock name from yahoo finance's ticker summaries
- Optional feature overlaying P/E of S&P, or of individual industries, over a stock price.

Currently, the project has a generic looking GUI able to search for US stocks across multiple periods and a machine learning component which works well but requires refinement.
